1. Follow the documentation format in README_rest_api.md

2. userid should not be provided by the frontend
   it is retrieved dynamically from the token in the authorization header

3. all dates return should be in epoch format because of timezone issues.
   backend always return epoch so front end can display based on the user's timezone.

4. whats is the color format? please add description in the documentation. #FFFFFF or FFFFFF?

5. please add description on parameters
   the documentation should good enough such that frontend team does not NEED to consult the backend team in order to use the APIs

6. for gateway dashboards, only need devicename or deviceid; no need for both
   backend can retrieve the database

   for sensors, you need devicename OR deviceid,    
   AND sensor LDSU UUID, sensor LDSU number
   - this refers to "source" and "number" parameters in the "i2csensors" database collection
   - LDSU is a multisensor. the number represents the index. ergo both needed

7. expose functions to delete DEVICE and delete LDSU (no need for delete SENSOR because user can only delete LDSU) .

   EX. when user deletes the LDSU, then the associated sensors in all user's/org's dashboards should be deleted
   EX. when user unregisters the DEVICE, then the associated device and sensors in user's/org's dashboards should also be deleted

   - no need for rabbitmq for deleting apis. deleting resources will be synchronous anyways. message queuing is only for asynchronous container-to-container / microservice-to-microservice communication

   - also no need for events unless the threads for deleting will run in different thread with the restapi thread

   - if you use events, can simply use threading.Events. no need to a new library, pyemitter. that will only increase memory usage.

8. could not find code where username is retrieved from token and token is verified if expired/invalid.
   all APIs should do this.

9. all responses should have
   'status': string, 
   'message': string

10. why is the implementation separates /dashboards and /charts?
   this is WRONG.
   previous rest api definition was already correct.

   dashboards can contain multiple dashboard
   dashboard can contain multiple charts
   dont separate charts from dashboard

   To prevent conflicts with the API definitions, 
   use
   /dashboards/dashboard/{dashboardid}
   /dashboards/dashboard/{dashboardid}/charts/chart/{chartid}

   instead of
   /dashboards/{dashboardid}
   /dashboards/charts

11. put restapi/src/charts folder inside restapi/src/dashboards folder

12. all new dashboard-related database collections should start with "dashboard"
   all new payment-related database collections should start with "payment"

   makes it easy to debug/troubleshoot database issues


13. provide a summary of APIs for the entry points of each API in the respective files containing the API entry points

   this makes it easy to debug and troubleshoot the code

   #g_identity_authentication_list = [
   #    { "name": "SIGN-UP",                         "func": signup,                          "api": "/user/signup",                      "method": "POST"   },
   #    { "name": "CONFIRM SIGN-UP",                 "func": confirm_signup,                  "api": "/user/confirm_signup",              "method": "POST"   },
   #    { "name": "RESEND CONFIRMATION CODE",        "func": resend_confirmation_code,        "api": "/user/resend_confirmation_code",    "method": "POST"   },
   #    { "name": "FORGOT PASSWORD",                 "func": forgot_password,                 "api": "/user/forgot_password",             "method": "POST"   },
   #    { "name": "CONFIRM FORGOT PASSWORD",         "func": confirm_forgot_password,         "api": "/user/confirm_forgot_password",     "method": "POST"   },

13. use color pallette provided in Figma UI design

14. the 3rd button should be Actuators, not Sensors (Sensors repeated twice)

15. all responses should have
   'status': string, 
   'message': string

   - this still does NOT appear on ALL responses
     please ADD to all APIs and update documentation accordingly.

16. remove 'data' parameter if value is true/false
    that is redundant with 'status' OK/NG
    update documentation accordingly.

17. i should not be allowed to add the same gateway attribute more than once.

    i selected device 1, same donut chart, online/offline attribute.
    it did not fail. i can see the chart two times.

    the api should prevent adding the same chart for same device, same device attribute

18. the colors of the bar chart or donut chart are the same color everytime.
    it should at least round robin

19. the dashboard list on the left side is still too big. reduce size to two-thirds


===============================================

20. deleting device should delete related entries in the dashboards gateways and dashboard sensors
    add your function in rest_api_device.py device_cleanup()

21. The GETS api only returns dataset for the 1st attribute.
    so for count of alerts, sms is the 1st attribute

    to get data for email, need to call GET DETAIL.

    Please prepare a new API, GETS EX api 
    - this should return all datasets/datasetsEx for all attributes 
      (ex. for count of alerts, it should return dataset for sms, email, notification in 1 API call)

22. sensors folder still outside of dashboards folder. please put inside dashboards too similar to gateways.

23. Why does the DELETE Chart have query params?

        D. DELETE
        - Request:
        DELETE: /dashboards/dashboard/{dashboardId}/sensors/{chartId}
        headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token.access}
        queryParams:
            - minutes: int  (optional,)
            - timestamp: int (optional)
            - points: int  (optional)

            * Note:
            - minutes: int  (default = 5 min, should convert hour or day to minutes)
            - timestamp: int (default = currentTime now, unit of timestamp is unix timestamp. For example: 1593760508 )
            - points: int  (default = 30, Just use only 30 & 60 points)

24. You committed device secret key again :(

    Please remove device secret key in the device simulator batch file. 
    Its actually NO LONGER NEEDED in the device simulator. 
    It is only needed to be set as environment variable in the backend

    So you wont commit the device secret key again 

25. Display the LDSU port and LDSU uuid (See screenshot)

    LDS port = sensor["port"]
    LDSU uuid = sensor["source"]

26. Popup error appears when im adding sensor chart. 

    Device does not need to be online (See screenshot)

27. Disable NEXT button until the sensors actually appear. 
    Enable NEXT button only when the sensors actually appear.

28. Change sensor list to table to easily view the list of sensors. (OPTIONAL)

29. after i run the device and enabled the sensor, so i added the chart but the sensor chart did not appear
    gateways appear but sensor does not appear
    but the rest api seems to be polled continuously

    only after refreshing does it appears

30. theres a scaling issue with the maximum and minimum
    the y-axis max and min should be fixed using the sensor["minmax"][0], sensor["minmax"][1]

    (see my implementation in OLD DASHBOARD PAGE on how to fix this problem)

31. the legend appears as UNDEFINED. 
    this is likely because your are providing a single array for data.
    send ARRAY of ARRAYS instead.

    data, low, high are array of arrays
    'dataset':  {'labels': [], 'data': [[],...], 'low': [[],...], 'high': [[],...]},

    (see my implementation in OLD DASHBOARD PAGE on how to fix this problem)

32. when i exit the dashboard page, i see that the REST apis are still getting called. (CRITICAL ISSUE)

    when i exit the page, it should also stop polling.

    (see my implementation in OLD DASHBOARD PAGE on how to fix this problem)

33. after i remove the sensor chart, the API is still getting polled.

34. display historical data (left and right buttons)

   (see my implementation in OLD DASHBOARD PAGE on how to fix this problem)

   for example current time is 9:00 and time range is 5 minutes so 9:00 to 9:05
   if i want to view 855-9:00, i should be able to click some left button to view data from that timespan 
   if i want to view 850-8:55, i should be able to click some left button twice to view data from that timespan 

35. display latest sensor reading 

   (see my implementation in OLD DASHBOARD PAGE on how to support this)

    API is returning latest sensor reading but web page not displaying the values yet

36. fix tooltip to display aggregated data, aggregated low, aggregated high and readable datetime

   (see my implementation in OLD DASHBOARD PAGE on how to fix this problem)


===============================================

37. Gateway label in Sensor Dashboard 
    - this is not the Gateway UUID, this is the LDSU UUID. Wrong label

38. add gateway name and gateway uuid in sensor charts dashboard
    - so its easy to know which sensor to enable

39. default should also be 5 minutes so that you dont hide the y-min issue. 
    you are hiding the y-min issue thats why you change default to 15 minutes

40. major issue, with 5 minutes (no aggregation), the data being graphed is total wrong. 

    it does not match the data in the device simulator
    when there's no aggregration, the data in the graph should exactly match the one sent by the device

    with my old dashboard, its exactly the same (latest datapoint in graph matches latest data sent by device simulator. 
    (so there's no issue with the data producer/data storage. the issue is with the data consumer - so its your dashboard)

    no aggregration = no calculation of average, low, high since its the every 60 x 5 == 300 seconds exactly matches with 5 minutes (300 seconds)

41. add dropdown option to select 30 points or 60 points (maybe beside compare button) 

42. In sensor compare, when i exit the page, the webapp is still querying the rest api. 
    it should also stop polling after exiting the page. (i clicked X mark at the top left) - CRITICAL


===============================================

43. aside from sensor["minmax"], API should also return other sensor properties

    sensor["unit"] - unit of measurement (C, %, etc)
    sensor["format"] - int or float 
    sensor["accuracy"] - number of decimal places

44. data correctness for 5 minutes timerange is OK (but missing the last point - 4 minutes 55 seconds)

45. data correctness for other time ranges have discrepancies with the aggregated data 
    the aggregated low/high not displayed so cannot easily verify as well

46. compare works 1st time only
    for the 2nd and nth trials, it always fails (no popup error)
    in the rest api logs, some error 
        invalid litreral for int() with base 10: undefined

47. token expiration not handled in dashboard pages.
